strike-induced loss of 0.49 percent of esti-
mated working time in mining was largely
attributable to a major stoppage in the bitu-
minous coal industry and an 80-day strike at
mines of the Kennecott Copper Corp. In con-
"struction, idleness increased by more than"
"40 percent over the 1963 level, but remained"
considerably below the industry average for
the preceding decade. The number of stop-
"pages in construction (944), however, reached"
its highest level since 1953. Idleness in
wholesale and retail trade rose to its high-
"est level since 1959, but accounted for a"
small percentage (0.04) of total estimated
working time.
