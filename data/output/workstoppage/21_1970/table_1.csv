Affiliation of unions
Strikes in which AFL-CIO unions participated in
1970 declined 2 percent from the 1969 level of 66 per-
"cent, while man-days idle attributable to such stoppages"
"accounted for only 48 percent of the total, a drastic"
drop from 69 percent in 1969. (See table A-3.) Major
stoppages initiated by the United Auto Workers and the
"International Brotherhood of Teamsters, two unaffili-"
"ated unions, were responsible for 78 percent of all"
idleness due to strikes by unaffiliated unions and 31
percent of total idleness for 1970.
"In 1970, the AFL-CIO represented approximately 71"
percent of total union and professional and public em-
ployees association membership.  4 The Federation rep-
resents 77 percent of all union membership in the
"United States, a drop from 1966's level of 85 percent,"
before the disaffiliation of the United Auto Workers.
