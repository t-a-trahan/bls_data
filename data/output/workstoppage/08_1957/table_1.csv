"than a fourth of all strike idlenessâ€”compared with three-tenths and one-tenth,"
"respectively, in 1956. Federal, State, and other government mediation and"
conciliation services helped settle about a third of the stoppages involving
"almost half of the workers and two-thirds of the idleness; in 1956, they helped"
"settle about the same proportion of stoppages, involving three-fifths of the"
workers and four-fifths of all idleness.
Workers returned to their jobs or were replaced by new employees
without negotiation of settlements in 17 percent of the strikes recorded. Ten
percent of the workers and 7 percent of the man-days of idleness were ac-
"counted for in this group. In almost 1 percent of the year's strikes, the estab-"
lishments involved discontinued business.
Disposition of Issues
"As usual, in the vast majority of strikes the issues in dispute were"
settled or otherwise disposed of when the work stoppage ended (table 14).
These disputes (which include those resolved by agreement to use the company's
grievance procedure and those in which the workers returned without  a formal
agreement or settlement that there would be further negotiation regarding the
issues) accounted for 88 percent of the strikes and workers involved and 94 per-
cent of the total idleness.
Work was resumed while negotiations between the parties were con-
tinued on the disputed issues in approximately 5 percent of the year's strikes
ending in 1957. These stoppages included a slightly smaller percentage of
workers and about 2 percent of the idleness. The remainder were ended by
"agreement to return to work while negotiating with the aid of a third party,"
"by submitting the dispute to arbitration, or by referral of the issues to govern-"
ment or other agencies for 'a decision or an employee representation election.
